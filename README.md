The gameplay is simple and is very much interesting. All you have to do is the control your and make a jump over the blocks and collect the coins. The player has to run over the bombs so that they wonâ€™t hit you. Here you have to make your Ninja jump and try to avoid the coming threats. The control key is your mouse. When you keep progressing the game, the game speed will generally increase at a greater rate. Try to jump higher by pressing the control buttons so that ninja can jump much higher to avoid the obstacles. When you end up hitting the obstacle you can finally view your score.
